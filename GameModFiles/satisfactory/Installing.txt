As the mod tools have yet to be updated for V1.0 of satisfactory you will need to copy the files manually 
to the correct directory.

How to install the satisfactory extension for streamroller.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Install folder in satisfactory. If running from steam the usual place will be in
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common"

From there you need to copy the files into the 'common\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods' directory

There are three parts to the mod explained below. These can be found in the StreamRoller directory 
    "%appdata%\..\local\StreamRoller\GameModFiles\satisfactory"

Installing the mod files
------------------------
1) The mod itself. 
Found in "%appdata%\..\local\StreamRoller\GameModFiles\satisfactory\streamroller\StreamRoller-Windows.zip" 
Create a new folder called 'StreamRoller' in your Mods directory and extract the contents of this zip so into that directory. 
You should end up with a folder called StreamRoller in the Mods folder
    <install directory>\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods\StreamRoller\
This folder should contain the following
    folder Binaries 
    folder contents
    folder Resources
    file StreamRoller.uplugin

2) SocketIo dependancy mod
StreamRoller needs another mod called SocketIOClient. 
If you don't have this mod already (ie the Mods folder doesn't include the SocketIOClient folder) then follow the same steps for 1) above for the SocketIOClient mod.
You should end up with a folder called 
<install directory>\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods\SocketIOClient\

3) SML (SatisfactoryModLoader)
SML is the mod used to load mods into the game. Currently this is the part that all mod makers are waiting to be 
updated to Satisfactory v1.0. Until this is updated you can use my developement vers to enable mod loading into 
the game.
As for 1) above install this like any other mod. ie copy the contents of the SML-Windows.zip into a folder called SML in the mods directory.
You should end up with a folder called 
<install directory>\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods\SML\

Checking it worked
------------------------
If all has worked correctly you should now see the StreamRoller mod in the mods options in game.
Happy playing.
