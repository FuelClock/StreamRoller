# About
The live streaming portal is a webpage that you can use on your second monitor to show all the information/settings you need on one page. The idea is to save having to switch programs in order to do things and to have the information you need in one place.
I would expect this to be something that people will want to customise to what you need for streaming. 

If you creatate a portal page for your streaming please consider sharing it so that others who might have similar requrements can use it.

## Current features (under developement)
Still in early stages of development the portal is still limited until I get OBS extension etc done. Currenlty copied from the adminpage code so needs stuff removing.
-   Displays chat window as the main window
-   Displays a mod chat window below the chat window
-   Uses the AdminModals provided by extensions to allow configuration. These will be replaced with a live streaming modals eventually as you wouldn't expect a different set of features while live streaming
-   Displays OBS scenes. Three levels availalbe, Primary scnes always displayed. Secondary and 'All' scene options
-   Primary and secondary scenes are depicted by prepending the scent title with a configurable set of charactors.
-   OBS streaming stats shown, uptime, bitrate and a health indicator
