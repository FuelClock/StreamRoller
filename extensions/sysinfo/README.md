## Outgoing channel : "SYSINFO_CHANNEL"
## Description
The sysinfo extension is designed to provide system information for other extensions to use. For some values to be read you may need to run streamroller 
in admin or sudo mode. For example on windows a lot of the data cannot be read by a user (only an admin). This protects things like uuid's from being read 
but there are also some other things like temperatures that might not show up unless run as admin. On windows you can do this by selecting the StreamRoller 
icon on the desktop and right clicking to set it to run as administrator. Alternativly you can start a command prompt as administrator (right click and 
select run as administrator) and then run StreamRoller from that prompt
